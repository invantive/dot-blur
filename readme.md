DotBlur is a fork from Obfuscar. The name was altered to avoid confusion during use.

## Description

DotBlur is based on Obfuscar as an open source .NET obfuscator released under MIT license. Obfuscar provides basic obfuscation features that help secure secrets in a .NET assembly.

DotBlur improves Obfuscar in the area of code signing.
